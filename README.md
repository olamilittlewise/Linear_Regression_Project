## Introduction
In today's digital age, the success of any business hinges on its ability to provide a seamless and engaging online experience for its customers. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, companies must strategically invest their resources to ensure they meet customer expectations and drive growth. The Shine Cosmetic Company company based in New York City, a prominent player in the cosmetics industry, recognizes the pivotal role that its mobile app and website play in reaching and retaining customers, they also have in-store products and cosmethology advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have meetings with a personal cosmethologist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the cosmetics they want.

## Problem Statement
The purpose of this project is to determine the optimal avenue for the Shine Cosmetic  to channel its efforts: enhancing the mobile app experience or refining the website. As a contracted consultant entrusted with this critical decision, we aim to leverage data-driven insights and a holistic understanding of user behavior to guide the company's strategic direction.

## Conclusion/Recommendations

In this context, the decision to prioritize either the mobile app or the website holds significant implications. By blending quantitative data with qualitative insights, we will craft a solution that not only addresses the immediate needs of the company but also positions them for long-term success in an increasingly digital marketplace.
